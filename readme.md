Dataset of Electric Vehicle Real Trips

Description
===========

This dataset contains CSV files of two electric vehicle real trips. A Nissan Leaf e+ 62kWh and a Dacia Spring 33kW.
There are 29 trips for each car, completed during 4 consecutive days. Both cars where doing the exact same routes. These routes are urban and medium distance, and have different elevation profiles. Routes take place in the Basque Country, Spain.

Each folder of the dataset has the name of a vehicle. Inside each folder, the name of each CSV file indicates:

DATE_VEHICLE_ORIGIN_DESTINATION_UNIQUECODE.csv

- DATE: date of the trip in YYYYMMDD format. Dates are between 18/04/2023 and 21/04/2023.
- VEHICLE: make of the car.
- ORIGIN: origin municipality.
- DESTINATION: destination municipality.
- UNIQUECODE: unique numeric code for each CSV file.

For example: "0230420_NISSAN_EIBAR_DONOSTIA_054.csv"

CSV files have the following data:

- timestamp_data_utc: Date and time (in UTC) of the vehicle data.

- cars_by_speed_interval_80_100: Number of vehicles with a speed between 80-100km/h on the road section.
- cars_by_speed_interval_100_120: Number of vehicles with a speed between 100-120km/h on the road section.
- cars_by_speed_interval_0_50: Number of vehicles with a speed between 0-50km/h on the road section.
- cars_by_speed_interval_50_80:Number of vehicles with a speed between 50-80km/h on the road section.
- cars_by_speed_interval_80_120: Number of vehicles with a speed between 80-120km/h on the road section.
- cars_by_speed_interval_120_inf: Number of vehicles with a speed higher than 120km/h on the road section.
- cars_by_length_interval_0_7: Number of vehicles with a length of less than 7 meters on the road section.
- cars_by_length_interval_7_inf: Number of vehicles with a length greater than 7 meters on the road section.
- max_speed (km/h): Maximum speed allowed on the road.
- radius: Distance from the position of the car and the traffic meter in km.

Regarding frontal wind, this can be positive or negative. Positive means the wind pushes in the same direction of the car and negative is the oposite.
